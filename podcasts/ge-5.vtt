00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:03.359
Hey Trojans, and welcome back to

2
00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:05.159
General Education. I'm your host

3
00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:07.229
Kevin Gramling. On this episode

4
00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.489
we're recapping the newly

5
00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:10.499
renamed Allyson Felix Field and

6
00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:12.479
USG's latest measure drafted to

7
00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.219
increase funding transparency.

8
00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:16.409
After, we chat with our very own

9
00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:18.089
Jennifer Nehrer about her recent

10
00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:21.059
profile. Hey, we get it. You had

11
00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:22.679
a busy week. That's why we've

12
00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:23.879
got you covered with all of this

13
00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:25.679
week's latest highlights. The

14
00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.179
first story I'll be recapping is

15
00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:28.799
by Daily Trojan staffer Adam

16
00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:30.629
Soukup. About USC is newly

17
00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:32.489
renamed Allyson Felix field.

18
00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:35.189
Faculty, staff and students came

19
00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:36.749
together on Monday to celebrate

20
00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:37.859
the renaming of the track

21
00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:39.719
Stadium after Allyson Felix.

22
00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.609
Allyson accepted a commemorative

23
00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:43.499
plaque at the celebration. In

24
00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:44.879
her speech, she touched on her

25
00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.439
Christian faith and her family

26
00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:47.789
as sources of inspiration,

27
00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:49.739
crediting her accomplishments to

28
00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.119
the many people who contributed

29
00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:53.069
to her life. renaming the track

30
00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:54.689
not only honors Allyson's

31
00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:56.279
contributions to the University

32
00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.929
and her athletic activism, but

33
00:00:57.929 --> 00:00:59.489
also works to distance the field

34
00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.109
from its previous namesake

35
00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:02.909
former track and field coach

36
00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.949
Dean Cromwell, a public

37
00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.079
proponent of antisemitic views.

38
00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:08.909
Closing her speech, Alison told

39
00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.109
her daughter that she will never

40
00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:11.369
stop fighting to make the world

41
00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.809
a better place for her to grow

42
00:01:12.809 --> 00:01:13.199
up in.

43
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.960
Our next story is by Mateo Villalba-

44
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.300
Mutis about USG's measure

45
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.460
to address funding transparency,

46
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.050
USG's lack of funding

47
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.700
transparency has consistently

48
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.960
been a source of frustration

49
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.490
among Registered Student

50
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.170
Organizations at a senate

51
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.820
meeting Tuesday night. USG

52
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.290
tackled this topic head on

53
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.970
drafting a bill to increase

54
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.380
funding transparency, the

55
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.670
pressure to pass this bill by

56
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.840
the end of the school year is

57
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.730
felt by the senators. To them,

58
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.680
funding transparency is a matter

59
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.420
of USGS integrity as an

60
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.370
administration. The measure is

61
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.440
thorough, demanding clarity in

62
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.330
USGS funding decisions. Other

63
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.890
proposed ideas include clearing

64
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.510
up funding request timelines,

65
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.310
reasons for funding rejections

66
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.140
would also be added in clear

67
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.040
guidelines for funding

68
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.850
applications.

69
00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.880
Joining us today for our two-way

70
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.530
interview is assistant news

71
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.880
editor Jennifer Nehrer.

72
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.500
Jennifer's profile was for a

73
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.970
Queer Day of Silence edition.

74
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.250
The story centers on USC

75
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.990
Hillel's queer rabbinic intern,

76
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.790
Miriam Hoffman, whose

77
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.830
authenticity and openness about

78
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.360
her intersectional identity

79
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.070
inspires those around her.

80
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.130
[Kevin Gramling:] Hello, Jennifer, welcome back.

81
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.570
You have become a General

82
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.310
Education veteran. This is your

83
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.200
third time here, right? [Jennifer Nehrer:] Yeah.

84
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.670
Woah, thank you guys for having

85
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.800
me. [KG:] First of all, Miriam

86
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.210
Hoffman, who you did the story

87
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.530
on sounds like such a lovely

88
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.570
person. How did you come upon

89
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.430
her? How did you decide you

90
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.250
wanted to tell her story? [JN:] So um,

91
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.490
admittedly, this was the what

92
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.740
first had me on the story was

93
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.990
that it was in you know, the the

94
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.000
pitch sheet that news writers

95
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.110
could take from but I knew that

96
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.070
I wanted this story in

97
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.660
particular out of the the

98
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.150
options I had. Because I've met

99
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.830
Miriam a few times. Personally,

100
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.800
I wanted to participate in the

101
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.240
Day of Silence supplement, I

102
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.130
myself am queer. I'm also

103
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.390
Jewish. So I have that

104
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.830
connection to Hillel. I've been

105
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.500
to Hillel many times. As I said,

106
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.120
I've I've met and interacted

107
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.980
with Marianne herself before she

108
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.270
is, as you said, a wonderful

109
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.810
person.

110
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.830
And so I knew that if this story

111
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.270
was being offered up, as one to

112
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.760
tell, I wanted to be the one to

113
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.020
tell it and you know, have

114
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.460
another chance to interact with

115
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.670
Miriam and, and speak on the

116
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.340
story and tell her story because

117
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.990
I have such a close connection

118
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.030
to it. [KG:] Yeah, and I feel like the

119
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.290
close connection really comes

120
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.810
through in the story. So have

121
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.400
you done a profile-style article

122
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.140
before? How is approaching a

123
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.790
profile different from a typical

124
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:42.480
news story?

125
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.080
This is actually my first, this

126
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.970
is my first profile in a

127
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.740
collegiate newspaper. When I was

128
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.260
in high school, I was on my

129
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.330
school's paper for my junior and

130
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.940
senior years. And during my, I

131
00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.410
believe senior year exclusively,

132
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.690
I did a few profiles on some new

133
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.920
teachers that we had hired.

134
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.160
I still felt like this one was

135
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.870
very different. I,

136
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.690
the, the new teacher profiles

137
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.590
were kind of very,

138
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.070
very, very basic news stories,

139
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.920
where I just asked them, Who are

140
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.210
you? Where are you from? What

141
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.990
are you teaching?

142
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.110
I felt they were very, those

143
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.370
were very similar to a kind of

144
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.140
standard news format story.

145
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.410
What made this different is

146
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.360
instead of just asking, "Who are

147
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.890
you? Where are you from? What do

148
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.500
you do here?" I was asking for

149
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.850
someone's life story. And I was

150
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.340
asking for what made their job

151
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.110
meaningful to them and stuff

152
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.600
that you wouldn't find in a

153
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.260
standard news piece. While we do

154
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.990
have, kind of, why this matters-

155
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.360
type paragraphs in a standard

156
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.570
news story. That usually takes

157
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.930
up

158
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.600
a smaller portion of it because

159
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.000
we tend to avoid editorialize.

160
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.040
As is common practice for news

161
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.660
in this profile, I wasn't

162
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.240
editorializing, per se. But there

163
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.770
was more of a why does this

164
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.300
matter throughout the entire

165
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.540
story? And because I was, I was

166
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:16.560
speaking on something that was

167
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.000
so personal, or because I was

168
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.230
conveying something that was so

169
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.860
personal.

170
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.710
And actually, I mean, I went

171
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.450
into this having basically no

172
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.460
idea how to write a profile. I

173
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.960
think I bothered my editors a

174
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.090
little too much with, "Oh, no,

175
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.470
what's the word count? You know,

176
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.970
how do I, how do I make this

177
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.070
flow?" But I think I ended up

178
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.870
figuring it out in the end. [KG:] That

179
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.420
is so insightful, seriously. So

180
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:40.860
leading straight into this, this

181
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.770
is perfect: To you, why does this

182
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.750
matter? What do you hope people

183
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.220
will take away from the story?

184
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.870
Why is it important for people

185
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.910
to know about Miriam Hoffman?

186
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.720
[JN:] Well, I think that what Miriam

187
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.850
touched on during her interview,

188
00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.530
that the fact that the

189
00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:59.910
intersection of her queer and

190
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.400
Jewish identities was especially

191
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.780
important, I mean, the entire

192
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.460
queer Day of Silence supplement

193
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.810
features, very important

194
00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.280
stories, just because it's

195
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.290
important to spotlight members

196
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.030
of the queer community and of

197
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.980
just the USC community in

198
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.360
general that aren't necessarily

199
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.150
getting as much attention on any

200
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.790
given day. But stories that

201
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.560
feature intersectional

202
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.060
identities are even more

203
00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.200
important because they make, they,

204
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.260
they, they feature that overlap,

205
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.350
where, as as Miriam commented,

206
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.700
some religious texts can often

207
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.620
be very difficult for members of

208
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.810
the queer community, for various

209
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.820
reasons. And something that is

210
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.410
so important to feeling

211
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:44.910
comfortable in both Jewish and

212
00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:45.990
queer spaces is feeling

213
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.370
comfortable with those texts,

214
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.580
and working with them, and

215
00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.390
working them out for yourself. I

216
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.430
mean, as a Jewish and queer

217
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.050
person, I can comment on this, a

218
00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.630
lot of Judaism is just working

219
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.310
with texts and rationalizing

220
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.340
with texts and exploring the 15

221
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.650
different opinions by 15

222
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.540
different you know, scholars and

223
00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.460
rabbis that have come with those

224
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.580
texts, and making a space for

225
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.430
yourself within Judaism that is

226
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.050
comfortable and that is

227
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.970
accepting of every part of who

228
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.980
you are. [KG:] One of Miriam's friends

229
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.570
Ariela Moel, described one of

230
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:25.800
her positive interactions with

231
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.760
Miriam. [Ariela Moel:] Miriam has been such an

232
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.650
open book when it comes to Hillel

233
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.480
and an open book when it comes

234
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.160
to my Jewish questions. More

235
00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.860
specifically, I have stayed I

236
00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.120
remember one specific time where

237
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.740
I'd stayed after the Jewish

238
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:41.580
learning fellowship, just

239
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:42.840
talking 30 minutes with her

240
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.540
about my idea, my conception of

241
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.520
God. And for reference, I am

242
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.350
agnostic. So for me, that was a

243
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.950
really enlightening

244
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.330
conversation, because as you

245
00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.910
know, she's been an intern. And,

246
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.050
of course, she's quite

247
00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.940
religious. And for me, I'm not

248
00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.500
very religious, but I'm always

249
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.210
very open to hearing ideas about

250
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.430
a religion impacts daily life. And

251
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:03.420
for me, that was just a very

252
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.070
insightful conversation that

253
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.110
opened up my eyes to what it

254
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.460
means to really be Jewish, what

255
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.350
it means to believe in a God and

256
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:12.120
what it means to believe in a

257
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:12.750
higher power. 

258
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.600
[KG:] I really got this impression

259
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.860
that Miriam has found such a

260
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:17.970
healthy relationship to

261
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:19.320
religion. And that just makes

262
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.630
this story so important to tell.

263
00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.540
So this is a shorter question,

264
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.490
but I'm sure Miriam has plenty

265
00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:27.540
of friends who admire her to

266
00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.520
choose from. How did you end up

267
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.630
deciding to interview the friend

268
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.490
that you did interview, Ariela

269
00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.730
Moel? [JN:] so I know quite a few

270
00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.760
kids who are in Hillel or who

271
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.140
participate in Hillel.

272
00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.670
And Ariella is both a friend of

273
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.020
Miriam's and a friend of mine. I

274
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.490
know that she in particular is

275
00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.230
very, very involved with Hillel

276
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.420
and has done a number of frankly

277
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.950
very impressive things with

278
00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:55.830
Hillel and on her own. And I

279
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:56.580
thought that

280
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.930
hearing about Miriam's impact,

281
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.160
actually, I went into the

282
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.740
interview, not knowing I set up

283
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.990
the interview, knowing that she

284
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.220
had interacted with Miriam but

285
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.960
not necessarily to what extent.

286
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.080
And I wanted to see, you know

287
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.300
how someone like Miriam had

288
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.860
influenced someone who has done

289
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.510
so much with their time at

290
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:19.800
Hillel and the interview ended

291
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.570
up working out beautifully

292
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.750
because, as already said,

293
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:27.870
Miriam has been such such a huge

294
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.700
part of her freshman Hillel

295
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.910
experience, which she is able to

296
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.860
have done so much with. [KG:] Awesome.

297
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.930
Yeah. So we kind of touched on

298
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.540
this with this being the one of

299
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.190
your first profiles, and there's

300
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:42.450
also the aspect of this being a

301
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.100
story that is so close to home.

302
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.200
Did you learn anything working

303
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.760
on this piece? Were there any

304
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.500
challenges or surprises along

305
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:49.830
the way?

306
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.290
[JN:] Well, there was the initial

307
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.520
challenge of just, you know,

308
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.620
learning quickly how to write

309
00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.870
the profile piece, I guess what

310
00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:59.940
I, what I learned is

311
00:10:00.329 --> 00:10:01.649
moreso just what I learned

312
00:10:01.649 --> 00:10:04.019
about Miriam. I mean, I knew a

313
00:10:04.019 --> 00:10:05.699
bit about who she was from the

314
00:10:05.699 --> 00:10:07.619
few times that I interacted with

315
00:10:07.619 --> 00:10:09.629
her at Hillel. But I didn't know

316
00:10:09.629 --> 00:10:11.039
her full life story. I mean, I

317
00:10:11.039 --> 00:10:13.289
don't go kind of casually

318
00:10:13.289 --> 00:10:16.199
perusing the "About Us" section of

319
00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:18.449
the Hillel website. Maybe I

320
00:10:18.449 --> 00:10:19.499
shouldn't do that more often.

321
00:10:19.499 --> 00:10:22.199
But, you know, I learned so much

322
00:10:22.199 --> 00:10:23.639
talking with her and talking

323
00:10:23.639 --> 00:10:26.069
with the the people who, you

324
00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:27.539
know, have interacted with her

325
00:10:27.539 --> 00:10:29.189
like Ari and Dave Cohn.

326
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.510
And I just learned so much about

327
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.190
Miriam herself that I don't

328
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.620
think I would have learned in

329
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.330
just a casual conversation with

330
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:40.350
her. And that was that was

331
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.240
really enlightening to hear

332
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.340
about. [KG:] Well, those are all the

333
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.170
questions we had. Thank you for

334
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:47.340
coming in. Jennifer. [JN:] Thank you

335
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.530
for having me. [KG:] That was Jennifer

336
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.480
nearer an assistant news editor

337
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.490
here at the Daily Trojan. Now,

338
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.200
here is Miriam Hoffman talking

339
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.400
about what gives her life

340
00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.080
meaning. [Miriam Hoffman:] I, in my own ways, find

341
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.480
meaning in Judaism as a queer

342
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.480
person, and I really just want

343
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.520
anybody queer or otherwise to

344
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.380
find their meaning in Judaism.

345
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.630
And I hope that I can be a

346
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.210
resource for people. That is,

347
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.800
that is my only goal in life, is

348
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.260
to like help people find their

349
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.480
path into Judaism. And I really

350
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.550
want to be somebody who

351
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:27.000
brings people back in, and says,

352
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.500
like, "Actually, this is for you.

353
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.270
This is yours. And you can

354
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.270
own this in the ways that you

355
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.310
need to because it is yours. As

356
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.260
a Jew, you get this and it

357
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.160
doesn't have to be something

358
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.860
that is hard or hurtful, and it

359
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:41.670
shouldn't be [inaudible]
