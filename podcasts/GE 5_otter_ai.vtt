00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:05.159
Hey Trojans and welcome back to
General Education. I'm your host

2
00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:08.489
Kevin Gramling. On this episode
we're recapping the newly

3
00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:12.479
renamed Allyson Felix Field and
USG's latest measure drafted to

4
00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:16.409
increase funding transparency.
After, we chat with our very own

5
00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:21.059
Jennifer Nehrer about her recent
profile. Hey, we get it. You had

6
00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:23.879
a busy week. That's why we've
got you covered with all of this

7
00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:27.179
week's latest highlights. The
first story I'll be recapping is

8
00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.629
by Daily Trojan staffer Adam
Soukup. About USC is newly

9
00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:35.189
renamed Allyson Felix Field.
Faculty, staff and students came

10
00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:37.859
together on Monday to celebrate
the renaming of the track

11
00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:41.609
stadium after Allyson Felix.
Allyson accepted a commemorative

12
00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:44.879
plaque at the celebration. In
her speech, she touched on her

13
00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.789
Christian faith and her family
as sources of inspiration,

14
00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:51.119
crediting her accomplishments to
the many people who contributed

15
00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:54.689
to her life. renaming the track
not only honors Allyson's

16
00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:57.929
contributions to the University
and her athletic activism, but

17
00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.109
also works to distance the field
from its previous namesake

18
00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:04.949
former track and field coach
Dean Cranwell, a public

19
00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.909
proponent of antisemitic views
closing her speech, Allyson told

20
00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.369
her daughter that she will never
stop fighting to make the world

21
00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.199
a better place for her to grow
up in.

22
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.910
Our next story is by Mateo
Villalba-Mutis, about USG's

23
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.780
measure to address funding
transparency, USG's lack of

24
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.330
funding transparency has
consistently been a source of

25
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.840
frustration among registered
student organizations at a

26
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.290
senate meeting Tuesday night.
USG tackled this topic head-on,

27
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.380
drafting a bill to increase
funding transparency. The

28
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.840
pressure to pass this bill by
the end of the school year is

29
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.680
felt by the senators. To them,
funding transparency is a matter

30
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.370
of USG's integrity as an
administration. The measure is

31
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.330
thorough, demanding clarity in
USG's funding decisions. Other

32
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.510
proposed ideas include clearing
up funding request timelines,

33
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.140
reasons for funding reductions
would also be added in clear

34
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.850
guidelines for funding
applications.

35
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.200
Joining us today for our two-way
interview is assistant news

36
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.480
editor Jennifer Nehrer.
Jennifer's profile was for our

37
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.870
Queer Day of Silence edition.
The story centers on USC

38
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:11.810
Hillel's queer rabbinic intern,
Miriam Hoffman, whose

39
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.380
authenticity and openness about
her intersectional identity

40
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.060
inspires those around her.

41
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.590
Hello, Jennifer, welcome back.
You have become a General

42
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.220
Education veteran. This is your
third time here, right? Yeah.

43
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.790
Well, thank you guys for having
me. First of all, Miriam

44
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.550
Hoffman, who you did the story
on, sounds like such a lovely

45
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.420
person. How did you come upon
her? How did you decide you

46
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.510
wanted to tell her story? So um,
admittedly, this was the, what

47
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.980
first had me on the story was
that it was in you know, the the

48
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.130
pitch sheet that news writers
could take from but I knew that

49
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.650
I wanted this story in
particular out of the the

50
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.820
options I had. Because I've met
Miriam a few times. Personally,

51
00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.230
I wanted to participate in the
Day of Silence supplement, I

52
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.380
myself am queer. I'm also
Jewish. So I have that

53
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.490
connection to Hillel. I've been
to Hillel many times. As I said,

54
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.970
I've I've met and interacted
with Miriam herself before; she

55
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.830
is, as you said, a wonderful
person.

56
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.260
And so I knew that if this story
was being offered up, as one to

57
00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.010
tell, I wanted to be the one to
tell it and you know, have

58
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.660
another chance to interact with
Miriam and, and speak on the

59
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.980
story and tell her story because
I have such a close connection

60
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.280
to it. Yeah, and I feel like the
close connection really comes

61
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.390
through in the story. So have
you done a profile-style article

62
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.810
before? How is approaching a
profile different from a typical

63
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:42.470
news story?

64
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.990
This is actually my first â€” this
is my first profile in a

65
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.250
collegiate newspaper. When I was
in high school, I was on my

66
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.930
school's paper for my junior and
senior years. And during my, I

67
00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.680
believe senior year exclusively,
I did a few profiles on some new

68
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.910
teachers that we had hired.

69
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.860
I still felt like this one was
very different. I

70
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.580
the the new teacher profiles
were kind of very,

71
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.910
very, very basic news stories,
where I just asked them, Who are

72
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.980
you? Where are you from? What
are you teaching?

73
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.360
I felt they were very, those
were very similar to a kind of

74
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.160
standard news format story.

75
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.380
What made this different is
instead of just asking, Who are

76
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.520
you? Where are you from? What do
you do here? I was asking for

77
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.330
someone's life story. And I was
asking for what made their job

78
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.590
meaningful to them and stuff
that you wouldn't find in a

79
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.980
standard news piece. While we do
have kind of why this matters,

80
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.560
type paragraphs in a standard
news story. That usually takes

81
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.920
up

82
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.200
a smaller portion of it because
we tend to avoid editorializing.

83
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:06.650
As is common practice for news.
In this profile, I wasn't

84
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.760
editorializing per se. But there
was more of a, Why does this

85
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.530
matter throughout the entire
story? And because I was I was

86
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.990
speaking on something that was
so personal or because I was

87
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.850
conveying something that was so
personal.

88
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.530
And actually, I mean, I went
into this having basically no

89
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.950
idea how to write a profile. I
think I bothered my editors a

90
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.460
little too much with Oh, no,
what's the word count? You know,

91
00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.060
how do I how do I make this
flow? But I think I ended up

92
00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.440
figuring it out in the end. That
is so insightful seriously. So

93
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.790
leading straight into this, this
is perfect to you. Why does this

94
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.210
matter? What do you hope people
will take away from the story?

95
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.930
Why is it important for people
to know about Miriam Hoffman?

96
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.870
Well, I think that what Miriam
touched on during her interview,

97
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.930
that the fact that the
intersection of her queer and

98
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.770
Jewish identities was especially
important, I mean, the entire

99
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.830
Queer Day of Silence supplement
features, very important

100
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.280
stories, just because it's
important to spotlight members

101
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.000
of the queer community and of
just the USC community in

102
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.140
general that aren't necessarily
getting as much attention on any

103
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.550
given day. But stories that
feature intersectional

104
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:28.220
identities are even more
important because they make they

105
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:34.340
they they feature that overlap,
where, as as Miriam commented,

106
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.610
some religious texts can often
be very difficult for members of

107
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.810
the queer community for various
reasons. And something that is

108
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.900
so important to feeling
comfortable in both Jewish and

109
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.360
queer spaces is feeling
comfortable with those texts,

110
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.570
and working with them, and

111
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.420
working them out for yourself. I
mean, as as a Jewish and queer

112
00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.620
person, I can comment on this a
lot of Judaism is just working

113
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.330
with texts and rationalizing
with texts and exploring the 15

114
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.530
different opinions by 15
different you know, scholars and

115
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:14.600
rabbis that have come with those
texts, and making a space for

116
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.040
yourself within Judaism that is
comfortable and that is

117
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.520
accepting of every part of who
you are. One of Miriam's

118
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.670
friends, Ariela Moel, described
one of her positive interactions

119
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:30.980
with Miriam. Miriam has been
such an open book when it comes

120
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.730
to hello and an open book when
it comes to my Jewish questions.

121
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.960
More specifically, I have stayed
I remember one specific time

122
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.570
where I'd stayed after the
Jewish learning fellowship, just

123
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:45.530
talking 30 minutes with her
about my idea, my conception of

124
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:49.370
God. And for reference, I am
agnostic. So for me, that was a

125
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.320
really enlightening
conversation, because as you

126
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.070
know, she's the rabbinic intern.
And, of course, she's quite

127
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:58.490
religious. And for me, I'm not
very religious, but I'm always

128
00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.030
very open to hearing ideas about
how religion impacts daily life.

129
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.090
And for me, that was just a very
insightful conversation that

130
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.480
opened up my eyes to what it
means to really be Jewish, what

131
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.110
it means to believe in a God and
what it means to believe in a

132
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.740
higher power. And

133
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:16.850
I really got this impression
that Miriam has found such a

134
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.310
healthy relationship to
religion. And that just makes

135
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:24.530
this story so important to tell.
So this is a shorter question,

136
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.530
but I'm sure Miriam has plenty
of friends who admire her to

137
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.650
choose from. How did you end up
deciding to interview the friend

138
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:35.720
that you did interview Ariella
Manuel, so I know quite a few

139
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:40.130
kids who are in Hillel or who
participate in Hillel.

140
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:46.010
And Ariella is both a friend of
Miriam's and a friend of mine. I

141
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:49.250
know that she in particular is
very, very involved with Hillel

142
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:52.970
and has done a number of frankly
very impressive things with

143
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.570
Hillel and on her own. And I
thought that

144
00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:02.180
hearing about Miriam's impact,
actually, I went into the

145
00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:06.980
interview, not knowing I set up
the interview, knowing that she

146
00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.950
had interacted with Miriam but
not necessarily to what extent.

147
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:15.320
And I wanted to see, you know
how someone like Miriam had

148
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.500
influenced someone who has done
so much with their time at

149
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.590
Hillel and the interview ended
up working out beautifully

150
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:27.890
because as as already said,
Miriam has been such such a huge

151
00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:32.930
part of her freshman Hillel
experience, which he is able to

152
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:36.950
have done so much with awesome.
Yeah. So we kind of touched on

153
00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:41.180
this with this being the one of
your first profiles, and there's

154
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.090
also the aspect of this being a
story that is so close to home.

155
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.750
Did you learn anything working
on this piece? Were there any

156
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.850
challenges or surprises along
the way?

157
00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.510
Well, there was the initial
challenge of just, you know,

158
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.860
learning quickly how to write
the profile piece, I guess what

159
00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.110
I what I learned is

160
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.010
More. So just what I learned
about Miriam I mean, I knew a

161
00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:07.610
bit about who she was from the
few times that I interacted with

162
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:11.030
her at Hillel. But I didn't know
her full life story. I mean, I

163
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:16.190
don't go kind of casually
perusing the about us section of

164
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.520
the Hillel website. Maybe I
shouldn't do that more often.

165
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.630
But, you know, I learned so much
talking with her and talking

166
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:27.530
with the the people who, you
know, have interacted with her

167
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.210
like Ari and Dave Cohn.

168
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:35.180
And I just learned so much about
Miriam herself that I don't

169
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:39.350
think I would have learned in
just a casual conversation with

170
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:42.230
her. And that was that was
really enlightening to hear

171
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:46.160
about. Well, those are all the
questions we had. Thank you for

172
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.550
coming in, Jennifer. Thank you
for having me. That was Jennifer

173
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:53.510
Nehrer, an assistant news editor
here at the Daily Trojan. Now,

174
00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.420
here is Miriam Hoffman talking
about what gives her life

175
00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:03.500
meaning I, in my own ways, find
meaning in Judaism as a queer

176
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:08.510
person, and I really just want
anybody queer or otherwise to

177
00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:12.650
find their meaning in Judaism.
And I hope that I can be a

178
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:16.820
resource for people. That is,
that is my only goal in life is

179
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:21.470
to like help people find their
path into Judaism. And I really

180
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.540
want to be somebody who

181
00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.490
brings people back in and says
like, actually, this is for you.

182
00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.260
This is yours. And you can

183
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:35.310
own this in the ways that you
need to because it is yours. As

184
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:38.160
a Jew, you get this and it
doesn't have to be something

185
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.850
that is hard or hurtful, and you
shouldn't be neutral in how you

186
00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:42.270
communicate it.

187
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.930
