00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.400
[Stefano Fendrich:] Welcome back, everyone, to Talkin'

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.630
Troy. This is Stefano

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:10.950
Fendrich, along with Darren

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.930
Parry. We are back again to talk

5
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.790
some USC sports. This is the

6
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.440
last episode of Talkin' Troy for

7
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.460
this semester. So we're here to

8
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.200
make it a good one. We're here

9
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.480
to cover five USC sports. We're

10
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.190
going to talk about water polo,

11
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.260
men's tennis, women's tennis,

12
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.790
and beach volleyball. And we're

13
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:27.660
going to start off with some

14
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.120
baseball. All of those teams had

15
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.280
fierce competitions with UCLA

16
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.230
this past weekend. And they're

17
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.490
preparing for some conference

18
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.100
tournaments and some key games

19
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.810
before they begin their

20
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.000
postseason push. So let's start

21
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.160
with baseball. And I mean, what

22
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.840
a series for USC baseball, this

23
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.090
is a defining series win, you

24
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.110
know, they dropped the opening

25
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.140
game. So 9-3, you

26
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.310
know, morale is a little low,

27
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.080
and then they come back when

28
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.870
Game 2, in Game 3, hit a walk

29
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.210
off to win the series. And

30
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.200
that's the first time they've

31
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.270
beat UCLA at home in a series

32
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.870
since 2005. Shout out Mike Bohn

33
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.550
for retweeting DT Sports'

34
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.650
Twitter account. But I mean,

35
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.880
man, what a game.

36
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.990
[Darren Parry:] What an ending, too, with Cole

37
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.210
Gabrielson just coming up clutch

38
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.200
in the last inning,

39
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.030
third-generation Trojan, what a

40
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.100
story from him. All throughout

41
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.200
the three games, just a stellar

42
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.930
atmosphere. I know Sunday's

43
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.550
game was sold out, Friday's game

44
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.990
was sold out. Saturday's game

45
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.580
look pretty packed, not sure if

46
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.040
it was sold out. But all sold

47
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.830
out against rival UCLA. Just

48
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.860
what a series and, yeah, another

49
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.350
guy to shout out is, of course,

50
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.900
Austin Overn. 11th and 12th

51
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.880
triples of the season. And on

52
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.200
Friday night, he hit both of

53
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.730
those in one game, bottom of the

54
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.620
first inning, he came up just a

55
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.760
triple, he's just a triple

56
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.100
machine. He broke the USC single

57
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.410
season triples record with his

58
00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.990
11th and 12th triples on Friday.

59
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.150
And he just keeps raking. He's

60
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.890
only five triples away from the

61
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.420
NCAA single season triples

62
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.930
record.

63
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.480
[SF:] I mean, man, this team is just

64
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.060
it's just seems so different

65
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.740
than what [we've] expected with

66
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.180
USC baseball these last few

67
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.650
years. I mean, if you look at

68
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.750
the team from last year, you

69
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.740
know, obviously you have the new

70
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.970
Head Coach coming in, Andy

71
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.310
Stankiewicz. But I mean, they

72
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.230
finished dead last in the Pac-12

73
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.410
with an 8-22 record. I mean,

74
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.000
this right now they're already

75
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.860
11-7, they surpassed their win

76
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.660
total a few months ago from last

77
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.250
season. I mean, this team is

78
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.890
different. This team clearly has

79
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.210
the belief that they can be

80
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.280
good. I mean, some of the

81
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.110
struggles with USC so far this

82
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.910
season is a consistent starting

83
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.610
pitching. But Darren, I mean,

84
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.260
like would you say it's gotten

85
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.280
better since the beginning of

86
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.730
the year?

87
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.710
[DP:] I think by far. Honestly, the

88
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.870
aura kind of seemed the same in

89
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:56.860
the beginning of the year as the

90
00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.840
past couple years. You know, we

91
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.930
swept Marist the first series of

92
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.480
the year, that was a really good

93
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.280
sign, but then they just kind of

94
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.230
went on like a little steady

95
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.420
downslope. They lost a couple

96
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.500
non-conference games to

97
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.240
Northridge. They got swept at

98
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.830
Auburn. So it was kind of

99
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.390
looking the same. But something

100
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.770
just turned around. The thing, I

101
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.320
think, that turned around their

102
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.850
season was the series against

103
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.050
Stanford. Stanford's a really

104
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.250
good team. They're a top 10

105
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.350
team. And they took two of three

106
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.660
here at Dedaux [Field]. And I

107
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.860
think that just gave them the

108
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.080
confidence and the momentum to

109
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.870
just propel them like they have.

110
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.220
After winning this series

111
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.050
against UCLA, they're third in

112
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.940
the Pac-12. They're tied with

113
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.650
Oregon for third in the Pac-12.

114
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.920
And I think they can make a real

115
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.730
good push.

116
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.600
[SF:] I mean, yeah, I mean, looking at

117
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.370
the standings, you have Arizona

118
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.440
State in first, Stanford in

119
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.340
second, Oregon, USC, and USC is

120
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.630
tied for third right now with

121
00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.920
Oregon. But, you know, there's

122
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.080
only two games separating first

123
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.660
and fourth right now. So there

124
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.160
are some pretty key games coming

125
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.630
up in the schedule that you

126
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.970
know, this weekend. They have

127
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.860
they have Washington, Washington

128
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.390
is near the middle of the pack,

129
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.220
so definitely no pushover but

130
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.810
you know, they have, still have

131
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.430
three games against Oregon left,

132
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.480
they have another series against

133
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.830
Arizona State. I think those are

134
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.440
two very key matchups. I mean,

135
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.450
if USC can win both of those

136
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.950
series, they could very well be

137
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.090
sitting alone at the top of the

138
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.340
pack. And if you think, you

139
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.840
know, thinking about where they

140
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:31.620
were at the beginning of this

141
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.790
season, that's like unheard of

142
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.200
to think that was even possible.

143
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.070
[DP:] Yeah. When you look at the

144
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.900
schedule, I mean, it seems like

145
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.580
like after this win against

146
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.290
UCLA, like it seems like oh,

147
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.120
like we have like, like a big

148
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.710
head of steam going into the

149
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.080
tournament, but like they cannot

150
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.910
settle because now looking at

151
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.860
the schedule, they still have

152
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.750
four Pac-12 series left, that's

153
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.450
12 more games. If they drop like

154
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.430
half of those games, that will

155
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.930
drop them a lot in the standing,

156
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.450
so they still need to keep their

157
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.280
eye on the prize and still keep

158
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.760
winning.

159
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:03.990
[SF:] That's what you gotta do. You

160
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.220
gotta keep winning to stay in

161
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.320
the hunt. And another team that

162
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.150
just seems to keep on winning at

163
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.370
USC is USC women's water polo.

164
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.110
When we come back from the break

165
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.900
we'll dive into some, uh, what's

166
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:16.860
going on with water polo.

167
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.360
[DP:] Welcome back everyone. USC

168
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.010
women's water polo capped off

169
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.450
its stellar regular season on

170
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:29.530
Saturday afternoon against

171
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.840
crosstown rival UCLA. So let's

172
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.190
jump right into what went down

173
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.630
this past weekend and what's in

174
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.040
store for the postseason for

175
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.400
them.

176
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.870
Saturday, they took down the

177
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.000
Bruins on the road 14-9, their

178
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.850
third win over UCLA this year to

179
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.180
improve to a crazy 25-1 record

180
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.590
to lock down the number one

181
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.770
overall seed in the NPSF. It was

182
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.720
their 13th straight win since

183
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.310
they fell to Stanford back in

184
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.470
February by just one goal.

185
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.090
[SF:] Yeah, that one-goal loss to

186
00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.290
Stanford, their only loss of the

187
00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.270
season, and they already avenged

188
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.820
that loss on a 17-12 win against

189
00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.020
Stanford on April 8. I was

190
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.820
actually at that game, crazy

191
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.040
atmosphere, crazy game. That's

192
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.590
the most goals Stanford has ever

193
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.450
allowed in its entire women's

194
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:14.860
water polo program history,

195
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:15.970
which is crazy to think about.

196
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.070
I was also at the game on

197
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.900
Saturday, the UCLA game, it was

198
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.610
their senior day; they had a big

199
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.980
crowd, but USC just came out

200
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.240
right from the gate and just

201
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.650
attacked them, went up

202
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.330
1-0, UCLA never held the

203
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.280
lead in the game. I mean, it's

204
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.980
kind of what - epitomized what

205
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.210
it's been for them all year:

206
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:35.260
dominance.

207
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:36.850
The thing about USC women's

208
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.200
water polo, it's not just one

209
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.280
player. You don't just have to

210
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.650
worry about two, three girls

211
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.320
even. There's, you have Paige

212
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.780
Hauschild, Bayley Weber, Tilly

213
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.030
Kearns, you have Grace Tehaney.

214
00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:50.980
We have all of these players who

215
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.440
can just constantly score and be

216
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.270
a threat at any given moment.

217
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.070
And that's just like their first

218
00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.540
line. They have so many

219
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.010
different combinations that they

220
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.740
can use to win. I mean, the team

221
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.150
last year was good, but this

222
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.070
team is this team is different.

223
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.420
This team is hungry, this team

224
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.130
is ready to go get that

225
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.210
championship back.

226
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:11.810
[DP:] What also stands out is their

227
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.400
whole defense: Against UCLA this

228
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.080
past weekend, they had 12 blocks

229
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.150
and seven steals their head

230
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.530
coach Marko Pintaric, he was

231
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:19.430
especially proud of their

232
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.020
defense after - after the win.

233
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.640
Stefano, aside from the other

234
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.930
players you mentioned earlier,

235
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.280
what else kind of stood out in

236
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.480
that game that you were out on -

237
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.010
on Saturday, right?

238
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.570
[SF:] Yeah, on Saturday. I think what

239
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.010
really stood out is I think

240
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.750
what's going to be the X Factor

241
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.640
for USC going into the

242
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.170
conference tournament, to the

243
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.030
NCAA tournament, is USC's

244
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:39.800
captives. You know, you have

245
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.260
Olympians Tilly Kearns and Paige

246
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.910
Hauschild and they were on full

247
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.710
display on Saturday. Tilly

248
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.450
Kearns scored five goals on the

249
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.310
win, four of which came in the

250
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.470
second half. Hauschild assisted

251
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.970
Kearns on three of those goals.

252
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.840
And you know, she wasn't just

253
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.490
assisting Kearns; she had six

254
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.770
total assists on the day. I think

255
00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.840
the two of them, the experience

256
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.540
they bring, the sheer dominance

257
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.400
they have in the pool, will help

258
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.050
propel them to the national

259
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.370
championship. I think they're

260
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:08.420
going to do it this year. I

261
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:09.890
don't even have to mention their

262
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:11.840
leading scorer, Bailey Weber.

263
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.130
You know what I mean? I think

264
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.740
this team is unbeatable at this

265
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.330
point. And we'll see it this

266
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:17.870
weekend.

267
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.190
You know, they set themselves

268
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.810
up, they have a first-round buy,

269
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.890
with the No. 1 overall

270
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.450
seed. They're gonna play the

271
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:25.280
winner of Indiana and Berkeley

272
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.710
on Saturday, and - two teams

273
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.440
they've already beaten. And it

274
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.150
just a matter of how much they

275
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.040
win at this point. We'll just

276
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.120
have to tune in and see.

277
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.940
[DP:] You know, with the 25-1 record,

278
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.850
and their only loss coming by a

279
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.400
margin of one goal, it's pretty

280
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.240
hard to beat that.

281
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.370
[SF:] Yeah, It really has. They really have

282
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:47.720
not had to rally much this

283
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.890
season. They've been ahead a lot

284
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.200
of the time. You know who has

285
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.330
had to rally? Men's tennis. When

286
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:54.320
we come back from the break,

287
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.340
we're going to talk a little bit

288
00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.870
about men's tennis and what

289
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.580
happened when they played UCLA.

290
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:05.900
[DP:] All right, we'll get back to,

291
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:07.250
back into the swing of things

292
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:10.010
with men's tennis. No. 10 men's

293
00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.470
tennis beat rival UCLA, of

294
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:15.050
course, 4-0 at Marks Stadium

295
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.030
last week on the 19th. This is

296
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.320
the third time that they swept

297
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.240
UCLA this season. So it was just

298
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.500
pure domination against the

299
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.030
Bruins this year. Stefano, you

300
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.140
want to explain what happened

301
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:25.430
this past week?

302
00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.600
[SF:] Yeah, it was kind of an all-

303
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.340
around effort. Freshman Learner

304
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.170
Tien And Bradley Frye beat the

305
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.410
Bruins' No.6-ranked duo 6-3, and

306
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:35.120
then Ryan Colby and Stefan

307
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.430
Dostanic are the No. 1 doubles

308
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:39.590
pair for USC, beat UCLA's duo

309
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.300
6-2 to clinch the doubles point.

310
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.060
And I mean, after that, it was all

311
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.550
just pure domination. The

312
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.320
singles were able to wrap up and

313
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.030
I mean, they ended the season on

314
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:51.710
a high note and claimed the

315
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.900
Pac-12 regular season title.

316
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.000
They're going to be ramped up

317
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.770
now as the No. 1 overall seed,

318
00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:59.630
the team to beat in the Pac-12.

319
00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.490
And they're also the team to

320
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:02.870
beat, considering they've won

321
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.190
the last three Pac-12

322
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:07.070
championships. So they have,

323
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.110
they have to defend the title.

324
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:11.210
And I mean, after this showing,

325
00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:13.340
beating UCLA so convincingly,

326
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.140
once again, I mean, it's hard to

327
00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.460
see a world where they don't

328
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:16.910
do that.

329
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.260
[DP:] Yeah. You know, as mentioned,

330
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.000
with water polo, it just seems

331
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.260
like the same thing, just pure

332
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.290
dominance. And securing the one

333
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.580
seat in the Pac-12 tournament

334
00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.920
for USC is a high advantage and

335
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.260
moving to No. 10 in the nation.

336
00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.740
Just gets them just on track for

337
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.120
another national title, like

338
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.570
Stefano mentioned. What do you

339
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.330
believe they can do to win the

340
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.200
Pac-12 tournament?

341
00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:44.750
[SF:] I mean, I think they just need

342
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:45.860
to keep doing what they're

343
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.690
doing. But I think one of the

344
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:49.850
things that, if you don't follow

345
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:51.110
the team, you might not know

346
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:52.910
about is freshman

347
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.470
Learner Tien, you know, he

348
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:55.940
sorted out his eligibility and

349
00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.860
he played his first match, I

350
00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:58.820
think it was two weeks ago,

351
00:10:58.820 --> 00:10:59.810
against Utah.

352
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:01.400
And I mean, this is a guy, if

353
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.600
you, if you don't know who he

354
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.490
is, he, in the junior, he made

355
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:05.210
noise in the junior

356
00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:07.010
competitions. He finished, he

357
00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:08.510
was the runner-up in the singles

358
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.460
tournament, and he won the

359
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:11.570
doubles tournament. I mean, this

360
00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.820
is a guy who you haven't had all

361
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.620
year, and with that type of

362
00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.720
pedigree, and you know, USC

363
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.680
hasn't necessarily been

364
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.730
struggling without them. And now

365
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:20.840
they have him. I mean, I just

366
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.980
can't, you know, the sky's the

367
00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.030
limit for the team at this

368
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.330
point.

369
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:24.890
And then you already have the

370
00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.540
combo with Dostanic and Colby -

371
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.580
Shoutout Colby DMV - on a

372
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.960
seven-game winning streak after

373
00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.860
losing their first game

374
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:31.910
together. You know, they're

375
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:33.200
going to be huge contributors in

376
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.390
the tournament. Dostanic is

377
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.250
also, has a really good pairing

378
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:38.690
with Frye. They're the No. 11

379
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:40.220
ranked duo in the nation. You

380
00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.540
know, they'll be huge too.

381
00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:42.470
You know, if you look at

382
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:43.790
singles, four of their players

383
00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.170
are ranked right now. Dostanic

384
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:46.790
the highest at 31. You

385
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.200
know, none of them have a losing

386
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.850
record. You know, this is a team

387
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:51.050
full of gamers and they should

388
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:52.310
cruise through the tournament,

389
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:53.360
and, you know, get that

390
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.980
guaranteed automatic bid in the

391
00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.780
NCAA tournament, you know. Make

392
00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.670
some noise, see what happens. I

393
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:59.510
do know their, their

394
00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:00.740
non-conference schedule was a

395
00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:01.820
little rough but they really

396
00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.100
rebounded quite well and now

397
00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.330
they're prepared for success.

398
00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.100
[DP:] Yeah, that Tien upgrade is

399
00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.610
crazy, because going from the

400
00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:12.830
Australian Open to competing

401
00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.440
with USC, that's just like an

402
00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.470
unfair upgrade because now USC's

403
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:23.090
record is 16-7 overall. But Tien

404
00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:24.980
has only competed in the last

405
00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:28.070
four matches and the last four

406
00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.500
matches, they've went 4-0,

407
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:31.580
that doesn't really seem like a

408
00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.570
coincidence to me.

409
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.460
[SF:] Yeah, Tien certainly been an ace

410
00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.800
up their sleeve. Speaking of

411
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.870
aces, right after this break,

412
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:39.830
we're going to touch a little

413
00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:40.910
bit more about tennis - this

414
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.130
time women's tennis. Don't go

415
00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:43.640
anywhere.

416
00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.350
Welcome back, everybody. We are

417
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:53.390
now here to talk some women's

418
00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:55.790
tennis. This past weekend No.

419
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:58.910
26-ranked USC fell to crosstown

420
00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:01.790
rival No. 19 UCLA and -

421
00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:02.600
[DP:] First loss of the

422
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.110
segment.

423
00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:05.000
[SF:] Ugh. And it was a, it

424
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.200
was a close one too, they lost

425
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.860
4-3 at UCLA's home. you know so

426
00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.480
UCLA started off strong, winning

427
00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.670
all three doubles matches. And

428
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:14.990
then the Trojans tied the match

429
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:16.640
with when Grace Piper defeated

430
00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.340
Sasha Vagramov in three sets.

431
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:21.500
and then USC just couldn't pull

432
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.550
it out at the end there.

433
00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.160
But I think the real surprise is

434
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:26.360
No. 8 singles player

435
00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.100
freshman Maddy Sieg lost her

436
00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:29.480
first singles match on Court 1

437
00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.310
of the year you know also losing

438
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:32.510
our first Pac-12 match of the

439
00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:34.040
year. Sieg has been the consistent

440
00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.480
point for the Trojans so far this

441
00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.370
year. I mean, her first loss, she

442
00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:38.810
had been dominant a freshman

443
00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:40.640
coming in, she played all her

444
00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.770
matches on Court 1, just kind

445
00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:44.810
of a rough going to have her

446
00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.150
lose a match. But I mean, when

447
00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:48.560
looking to the future, she's

448
00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.580
probably not going to lose too

449
00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:50.870
many more of those. She's been

450
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:51.860
dominant all year.

451
00:13:52.289 --> 00:13:53.609
[DP:] Yeah, that was kind of rare and

452
00:13:53.609 --> 00:13:55.769
unfortunate to see, she has been

453
00:13:55.889 --> 00:13:57.149
dominant all year. Yeah, with

454
00:13:57.149 --> 00:13:59.339
this being her only loss. But

455
00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:01.169
yeah, like you said like, I

456
00:14:01.169 --> 00:14:02.699
don't really see her losing any

457
00:14:02.699 --> 00:14:04.769
more matches, which I mean and

458
00:14:04.769 --> 00:14:06.959
if she takes care of her match

459
00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:08.999
and gets her point, that

460
00:14:08.999 --> 00:14:10.679
just means the rest of the team

461
00:14:10.679 --> 00:14:13.469
has has to step up like they

462
00:14:13.469 --> 00:14:15.449
have to excel in the Pac-12

463
00:14:15.449 --> 00:14:15.869
tournament.

464
00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:17.880
Speaking of the Pac-12

465
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.890
tournament, it's gonna get started

466
00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:21.960
this weekend. USC finished with

467
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.100
the 6-4 conference

468
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.540
record which gives them the No. 6

469
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:25.950
seed in the Pac-12 tournament,

470
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.150
an unfortunate place in the

471
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.860
bracket because if they do win,

472
00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:29.820
they're gonna then face the

473
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.040
No. 1 seed. The first match,

474
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.210
though, they have to get, take care

475
00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.230
of business, they're takin' on

476
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:35.550
Washington State. You know,

477
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.200
Darren, how can USC get past

478
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.850
their loss against UCLA and kind

479
00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:40.950
of rebound from that and look

480
00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:42.270
towards the Pac-12 tournament?

481
00:14:42.779 --> 00:14:43.949
[DP:] Yeah, like mentioned before, I

482
00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:45.629
think Sieg is a big factor, she

483
00:14:45.629 --> 00:14:48.299
needs to be just get basically

484
00:14:48.299 --> 00:14:50.459
her automatic point, because

485
00:14:50.459 --> 00:14:51.839
it should be an automatic point

486
00:14:51.839 --> 00:14:54.029
and be dominant in the win. And of

487
00:14:54.029 --> 00:14:55.169
course the dominoes still need

488
00:14:55.169 --> 00:14:56.339
to fall in place for the other

489
00:14:56.339 --> 00:14:58.019
players to do their job to

490
00:14:58.019 --> 00:14:59.939
secure their shot at the box of

491
00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:01.619
championship. Another note to

492
00:15:01.619 --> 00:15:04.529
mention, junior Naomi Cheong and

493
00:15:04.649 --> 00:15:06.659
redshirt sophomore Snow Han,

494
00:15:07.079 --> 00:15:09.089
after not losing their first six

495
00:15:09.089 --> 00:15:10.349
matches of the year, they've

496
00:15:10.349 --> 00:15:11.819
lost five of their last eight

497
00:15:11.819 --> 00:15:13.619
matches. So I think they're a

498
00:15:13.619 --> 00:15:15.539
pretty big X Factor for the

499
00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:18.179
Trojans to get going in order to

500
00:15:18.179 --> 00:15:20.549
get the to get the lone doubles point.

501
00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.040
[SF:] I mean, yeah, at this point,

502
00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:24.480
they basically need to win the

503
00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.340
PAC 12 tournament to make the

504
00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.870
NCAA championships at this point,

505
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:29.880
to get that automatic bid. You

506
00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:30.690
know, they've been to the end,

507
00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.710
they've been to the tournament

508
00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:33.720
the past three seasons. You

509
00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.890
know, looking at the first round

510
00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:35.610
matchup, they've already

511
00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:37.140
defeated Washington State

512
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.450
earlier in the year, even

513
00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:40.800
without Maddy Sieg playing, they

514
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.020
won 6-1. So looking at

515
00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:44.910
that you hope to get a good win.

516
00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:46.290
And we you know, we're talking

517
00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:47.670
about Sieg, that's just one point,

518
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:48.690
you know, you need other players

519
00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.430
like senior Eryn Cayetano and

520
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:52.260
freshmen Emma Charney, you know,

521
00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:53.460
they need to step up and

522
00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:56.100
advance. Kearney has not lost in

523
00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.390
her last 11 matches, so we'll

524
00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:58.650
see if she can keep that going

525
00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:00.690
in this tournament. I mean, it's

526
00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:02.040
all about a run who can get hot

527
00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.120
at the right time. You talk

528
00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.670
about this all the time. I think

529
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:07.110
it's just up to USC to see if

530
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:08.700
they can lock in, dig deep and

531
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:09.960
you know, make it to the next

532
00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.850
round. And speaking of digging

533
00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:13.500
deep, it's time to talk about

534
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.540
our final sport for this, for

535
00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.310
this show. And the semester.

536
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:19.770
Beach volleyball. We'll be right

537
00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:20.250
back.

538
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.530
Welcome back. We're Talkin'

539
00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.120
Troy. It's still Stefano and

540
00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.200
Darren and we're here to talk

541
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.710
about beach volleyball. One for

542
00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.350
the thumb. That's been the

543
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:38.940
only thing on USC's mind

544
00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.740
recently. They're on their quest

545
00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.880
for their fifth straight

546
00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.100
national title, their third,

547
00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.840
they're looking also for their

548
00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.580
third straight. This past

549
00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.650
weekend, though USC and UCLA

550
00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:50.880
face each other for the third

551
00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.920
time this year. Unfortunately,

552
00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.260
it did not exactly go and USC's

553
00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.320
way. UCLA was able to take beat

554
00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.570
when the second straight duel

555
00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:03.090
against USC, USC, UCLA is the

556
00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:04.080
No. 1 team in the country,

557
00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.630
USC is No. 3, you'll have

558
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:09.330
to imagine if USC wants to

559
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.590
achieve those championship

560
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:11.490
dreams, they're gonna have to

561
00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:14.190
run into UCLA once again. And I

562
00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:15.840
mean, in the duel about a week

563
00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.880
ago, when they did play USC, the

564
00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:18.810
Bruins really controlled the

565
00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:20.220
duel from the beginning, USC

566
00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.260
went on to lose 1-4. I

567
00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.000
mean there and how scary is UCLA

568
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:24.960
heading into the Pac-12

569
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.040
tournament? I mean, more

570
00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.300
importantly, you know that the

571
00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:28.410
NCAA tournament.

572
00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:30.330
[DP:] UCLA is the only other program

573
00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:31.500
to actually win a national

574
00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.120
championship. So of course,

575
00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:36.000
they're always a threat. But in

576
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.530
the last two weeks, their scare

577
00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:39.720
factor has skyrocketed. They

578
00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.010
took down TCU, who was

579
00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:42.450
previously undefeated, and then

580
00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:44.370
in the same weekend, they won

581
00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.890
that second matchup with USC.

582
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.810
Playing them twice at the very

583
00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:51.330
end is, of course, really good

584
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:54.030
practice, though, because USC

585
00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.680
has played a handful of

586
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.750
opponents more than once, like

587
00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:02.040
Florida State, LMU. And usually

588
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:05.490
their dual-point differential

589
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.620
increases, which probably means

590
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:08.970
that Head Coach Blanton is

591
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:10.290
probably really good at

592
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:14.940
preparing and and preparing his

593
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.110
game plan against repeat

594
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.420
opponents. USC can also keep it

595
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:19.440
pretty close throughout these

596
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.390
matches. So if they can force

597
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:23.880
UCLA into some three-set

598
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.790
matches, I think USC has a

599
00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.080
good chance to stay on top.

600
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.150
[SF:] And I mean, yeah, I think USC,

601
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:32.100
they have the recipe for

602
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.050
success. They know what it takes

603
00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:35.550
to win a national championship.

604
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:36.960
And I mean, I really think the

605
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.370
key is going to be Delaynie Maple

606
00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:40.020
And Megan Kraft. I mean,

607
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.190
they're, they're the best duo in

608
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:42.840
the country, hands down. You

609
00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.650
know, they've only lost to the

610
00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:45.120
Ferary twins from Georgia State.

611
00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:46.590
I mean, they're quite unique as

612
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.420
they're 5-foot-4. And you

613
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.830
know, they grew up playing beach

614
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.420
together rather than

615
00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:52.890
transitioning from indoor like

616
00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.930
most often so they often upset

617
00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:56.490
their opponents. And, you know,

618
00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:57.390
Kraft and Maple, they've been

619
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.460
near perfect. Kraft last year

620
00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.260
was a second team all American,

621
00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:03.630
after, you know, 13 seniors left

622
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:04.410
last year. So there were some

623
00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:05.820
big shoes to fill. But you know,

624
00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.020
Maple has been determined to

625
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.160
step up our game. And that's

626
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.870
exactly what they needed. You

627
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:11.280
know, the the pair communicate

628
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.510
really well. They play smarter

629
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:13.890
than their opponents, and

630
00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:14.760
they're constantly keeping the

631
00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.590
score close. If they haven't

632
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:17.790
already run away with the

633
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:18.930
win. You know, honestly,

634
00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:19.680
they're paired together

635
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.510
seamless. So I don't know, I

636
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:22.530
personally think it's safe to

637
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.060
say that to project that they'll

638
00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:25.650
be an all-American duo this

639
00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:26.850
season. And I think they are

640
00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:29.310
going to be the key if USC, you

641
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:30.780
know, hopes to keep its, three,

642
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.790
their three-peat hopes alive,

643
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.390
they'll probably

644
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.520
have to run into UCLA again. [DP:] And

645
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.020
like I mentioned earlier,

646
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.460
they'll probably have a pretty

647
00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.800
good game plan for them, and

648
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.500
just try and win another

649
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.460
national championship.

650
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:46.560
[SF:] I mean, yeah, that's all, all

651
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.730
these sports are trying to do.

652
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:50.190
But that's all we have. Thank

653
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:51.660
